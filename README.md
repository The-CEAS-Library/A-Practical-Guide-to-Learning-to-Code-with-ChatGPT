# A-Practical-Guide-to-Learning-to-Code-with-ChatGPT
Large Language Models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT, GPT4, and Palm-2 have significant potential as personal tutors across many domains, including coding.<br>

This workshop provides a practical guide to using LLMs such as ChatGPT as coding tutors and support systems. Participants will learn the basics of LLMs, focusing on their use in explaining coding concepts & syntax, generating code examples, suggesting coding solutions, and troubleshooting code.<br>

It includes hands-on activities and provides tips for optimizing interactions with these novel AI models for effective coding education with a focus on the python coding language. But the principles and tips generalize to other coding languages. This workshop aims to equip attendees with the necessary skills to best integrate these tools into their individual journey learning to code.<br>
